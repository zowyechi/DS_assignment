    "2. If you ever used Netflix, you should already have realized that it provides some recommendations for you to watch. In data science, this is an example of the so called recommendations systems. Read this non-technical blog post of Netflix about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model.\n",
